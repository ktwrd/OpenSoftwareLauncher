OSL Server 1.2.2.3, 2022-12-23
------------------------------------------
- `/token/grant` returns code `401` with type `ObjectResponse<HttpException>` if the account you want a token is disabled.
- Manager classes are access with an `IServiceProvider` now. If you want to access the account manager you would do `Program.Provider.GetService<MongoAccountManager>()`. This was apart of the `serverRestructure` branch.
- Add API Endpoints for the new FeatureManager. This means the response of `/server/details` has changed.
- General bug fixes and codebase restructure.
- Launch targets can be added with the attribute `LaunchTargetAttribute`.
